                    <p>I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. As a CogSci student, I took advanced classes in Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Computer Science. With my specialization, I learned about the psychology behind user experiences and how to study users to improve UI designs. Since graduating, I have continued to learn about the newest findings in Human-Computer Interaction and UX Design as a member of The Interaction Design Foundation. </p>
                    <p>An advocate for HCI and UX, my goal is to educate people on why user-centered design is important. Iâ€™ve created training guides, proposed new web processes, and taught company workshops to achieve this goal. I believe that knowledge and understanding will go further when you can share it with those around you. This is how I do my part to create ethical and helpful user experiences.</p>

                    <p>One of my flaws is also one of my greatest strengths. I am red/green colorblind so I have trouble distinguishing between two colors if they are not well saturated or are too similar in hue. My designs therefore will always have high contrast. I act as my own colorblind persona.</p>
                    <p>As an artist, I began by doing simple two- or three-color woodcut relief prints. Some of those woodcut are displayed on this website. As I started to create more traditional Mexican folk art, I realized I could use very bright, contrasting colors. My love of skulls, along with Houston's Art Car scene, culminated in me creating my second art car.</p>

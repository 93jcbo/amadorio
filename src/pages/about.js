                    <p>I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. I took advanced classes in Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Computer Science. I learned about the psychology of user experiences and how to study users to improve UI design.  As a member of The Interaction Design Foundation, I continue to learn about the trends in HCI and UX.</p>
                    <p>An advocate for HCI and UX, my goal is to educate people on why user-centered design is important. Iâ€™ve created training guides, proposed new web processes, and taught company workshops. Knowledge and understanding will go further when you can share it with those around you. I do my part to create ethical and useful experiences by helping those around me be better designers.</p>

                    <p>One of my flaws is also one of my greatest strengths. I am red/green colorblind, so I have trouble distinguishing between two colors if they are not well saturated or are too similar in hue. My designs will always have high contrast, because I act as my own colorblind persona.</p>
                    <p>As an artist, I began by doing simple two- or three-color woodcut relief prints. Some of those woodcuts are on this website. As I started to create more traditional Mexican folk art, I realized I could use very bright, contrasting colors. My love of skulls, along with Houston's Art Car scene, culminated in me creating my second art car.</p>
